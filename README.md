Welcome to my data analytics portfolio on Github! As a data analyst, I'm passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights and drive better business outcomes. This portfolio is a collection of personal projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and highlight the impact that data-driven insights can have on business success.

Within these projects, I've used a variety of tools and techniques to extract, transform, and visualize data, including SQL, Python JupyterNotebook, and Tableau. My projects showcase my ability to identify patterns and relationships in complex data sets, and to use sophisticated modeling techniques to generate actionable insights.

One of the standout projects in my portfolio is my work on exploratory data analysis, using K-nn classification and clustering on JupyterNotebook. In this project, I was able to uncover key insights that helped drive business decisions and improve outcomes. I've included detailed descriptions of the methods I used and the insights I uncovered, as well as relevant visuals and metrics that showcase the impact of my work.

Overall, my portfolio is designed to demonstrate my skills as a data analyst and highlight the value that data-driven insights can bring to businesses. I hope you find my work informative and engaging, and I look forward to discussing my portfolio with you further.
